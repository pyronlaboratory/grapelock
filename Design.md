# 1.

Application Layer: The user-facing layer that interacts directly with consumers, producers, and other stakeholders in the wine supply chain.

Modules/Components:

Decentralized Marketplace (for buying/selling wine): This would allow producers to list wine, consumers to purchase, and retailers to interact with the ecosystem.

Requires coding (smart contracts to handle transactions, escrow, and tokenization of assets).

Tracking and Certification dApp (to track wine provenance, quality, and certifications like organic or biodynamic status): Provides transparency in the supply chain.

Requires coding (smart contracts and integrations with external data sources for certification).

User Interface (UI): Dashboards for stakeholders to track wine shipment, transactions, and supply chain metrics.

Requires coding (front-end development for web/mobile UI).

Wallet Integration: Connect to Solana wallet for users to store tokens (SOL) and wine NFTs.

Requires coding (integration with Solana wallet SDK).

# 2.

Protocol Layer: The underlying blockchain logic and transaction rules to ensure the decentralized functioning of the supply chain.

Modules/Components:

Smart Contracts: These govern transactions, wine certifications, ownership, provenance, and other supply chain activities (e.g., contracts for wine batch creation, purchase agreements).

Requires coding (written in Rust or C, depending on the Solana program).

Tokenization of Wine Assets: Representing wine bottles, batches, or crates as NFTs or fungible tokens on Solana.

Requires coding (SPL Token and SPL NFT implementations).

Solana Consensus Mechanism: Leverages Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to secure transactions.

Requires configuration (staking validators on Solana network).

# 3.

Network Layer: The decentralized communication and infrastructure that supports Solana's operations.

Modules/Components:

Solana Validator Setup: Validators to confirm transactions and secure the supply chain network.

Requires configuration (validator node setup on Solana).

Data Propagation Infrastructure: Ensures fast and secure communication across Solana's network of validators and nodes.

Requires configuration (network setup for connecting to Solana's validator infrastructure).

Off-chain Data Integration: Integration with external data sources for provenance or certification data (e.g., weather, vineyard conditions, quality control).

Requires coding/configuration (API integrations with off-chain services or IoT sensors).

# 4.

Incentive Layer: Mechanisms to incentivize participation in the wine supply chain.

Modules/Components:

Reward System: Incentivizes wine producers, distributors, and consumers for participating (e.g., rewarding participants in SOL tokens or wine-based NFTs).

Requires coding (smart contracts for reward distribution).

Staking Rewards: Validators in the Solana network receive staking rewards.

Requires configuration (staking setup and reward mechanism configuration).

Supply Chain Performance Metrics: Incentivize actors based on supply chain performance, such as on-time delivery or wine quality.

Requires coding (smart contracts for performance-based rewards).

# 5.

Governance Layer: Decentralized decision-making to guide the network and its participants.

Modules/Components:

DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): Allows stakeholders (vineyard owners, distributors, consumers, etc.) to vote on key decisions like upgrades, rules, or changes in the supply chain.

Requires coding/configuration (DAO setup on Solana or through a governance platform like Coral or Metaplex).

Proposal and Voting System: For proposal submissions and decision-making via token-weighted voting.

Requires coding (smart contracts for voting and proposals).

# 6.

Security Layer: Securing the wine supply chain through cryptographic methods and ensuring data integrity.

Modules/Components:

Smart Contract Auditing: To ensure that all contract code is secure and free from vulnerabilities, especially in financial transactions like payments and reward distributions.

Requires auditing (manual or automated audit tools).

Data Encryption: Ensures data on the blockchain is secure and private. Sensitive data like consumer information or wine batch specifics need to be encrypted.

Requires coding (encryption of transaction data and off-chain integration).

Identity and Authentication: Secure user access and transactions via Solana wallet and 2FA.

Requires coding (authentication methods integrated with Solana wallet).

Certification Verification: Ensures wine certifications (organic, biodynamic, etc.) are legitimate and tamper-proof.

Requires coding/configuration (smart contract verification logic and integration with certification authorities).

# 7.

Data Layer: Decentralized data storage and management for the wine supply chain.

Modules/Components:

Decentralized Storage Solutions: Storing provenance data, quality control reports, and transaction history (using IPFS, Arweave, or Filecoin for decentralized storage).

Requires configuration (storage setup with IPFS or Filecoin).

Batch and Shipment Tracking: Storing information about wine batches, shipment logs, temperature monitoring, etc.

Requires coding (integration with decentralized storage for batch and shipment data).

Off-chain Data Linking: Link off-chain data (e.g., vineyard conditions, certification records) to on-chain transactions.

Requires coding/configuration (Oracle service integration or off-chain API).

# User journey and interactions

- REGISTER
- MONITOR

REGISTER:

Winery creates a unique digital twin (NFT) on Solana for each bottle.

Metadata includes:

- Grape origin, vintage
- Bottle serial, production date
- Certifier signature
- Winery wallet address

Using dApp winery sends a transaction to mint NFT (e.g., via Metaplex).
Bottle gets an NFC tag / QR code / RFID linking to its on-chain identity.

Single use vs Bulk/scale
