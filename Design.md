# 1. Protocols and Smart contracts

`grapelock/grpx-protocols` manages the underlying blockchain logic and transaction rules to ensure the decentralized functioning of the supply chain.

The rules and standards of the Solana blockchain, ensuring consensus and transactions. Solanaâ€™s Proof-of-History (PoH) mechanism helps ensure faster and more secure transaction finality in a decentralized manner.

The Solana Program Library (SPL) provides standard programming models for token and contract management.

### Modules:

- Tokenization of Wine Assets: Representing wine bottles, batches, or crates as NFTs or fungible tokens on Solana.
- Smart Contracts: These govern transactions, wine certifications, ownership, provenance, and other supply chain activities (e.g., contracts for wine batch creation, purchase agreements).
- Solana Consensus Mechanism: Leverages Proof-of-History (PoH) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to secure transactions.

# 2. Decentralized Applications

The user-facing layer that interacts directly with consumers, producers, and other stakeholders in the wine supply chain.

`grapelock/grpx-dapps` built on Solana's fast and scalable blockchain, dApps interact with users and provide decentralized services (e.g., decentralized marketplaces, IoT management, etc.)

### Modules:

- Wallet Integration: Connect to Solana wallet for users to store tokens (SOL) and wine NFTs.
- Registration: Initially done via web panel, later release mobile app and SDKs to provide ease of access for inventory registration and linking and activating IoT sensors.
- Marketplace: To enable producers to list wine, consumers to purchase, and retailers to interact with the ecosystem.
- Supply Chain Monitoring: Dashboards for stakeholders to track wine shipment, transactions, and supply chain metrics.
- Tracking and Certification: To enable stakeholders to track wine provenance, quality, and certifications like organic or biodynamic status. Provides transparency in the supply chain.

# 3. Networking

The decentralized communication and infrastructure that supports Solana's operations.

### Modules:

- Solana Validator Setup: Validators to confirm transactions and secure the supply chain network.
- Data Propagation Infrastructure: Ensures fast and secure communication across Solana's network of validators and nodes.
- Off-chain Data Integration: Integration with external data sources for provenance or certification data (e.g., weather, vineyard conditions, quality control).

# 4. Incentive and Reward Mechanism

To incentivize participation in the wine supply chain.

### Modules:

- Reward System: Incentivizes wine producers, distributors, and consumers for participating (e.g., rewarding participants in SOL tokens or wine-based NFTs).
- Staking Rewards: Validators in the Solana network receive staking rewards.
- Supply Chain Performance Metrics: Incentivize actors based on supply chain performance, such as on-time delivery or wine quality.

  <br>

# 5. Governance

Decentralized decision-making to guide the network and its participants.

### Modules:

- DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization): Allows stakeholders (vineyard owners, distributors, consumers, etc.) to vote on key decisions like upgrades, rules, or changes in the supply chain.
- Proposal and Voting System: For proposal submissions and decision-making via token-weighted voting.

  <br >

# 6. Security

Securing the wine supply chain through cryptographic methods and ensuring data integrity.

### Modules:

- Smart Contract Auditing: To ensure that all contract code is secure and free from vulnerabilities, especially in financial transactions like payments and reward distributions.
- Data Encryption: Ensures data on the blockchain is secure and private. Sensitive data like consumer information or wine batch specifics need to be encrypted.
- Identity and Authentication: Secure user access and transactions via Solana wallet and 2FA.
- Certification Verification: Ensures wine certifications (organic, biodynamic, etc.) are legitimate and tamper-proof.

# 7. Decentralized storage and off-chain Data:

Decentralized data storage and management for the wine supply chain.

### Modules:

- Decentralized Storage Solutions: Storing provenance data, quality control reports, and transaction history (using IPFS, Arweave, or Filecoin for decentralized storage).
- Batch and Shipment Tracking: Storing information about wine batches, shipment logs, temperature monitoring, etc.
- Off-chain Data Linking: Link off-chain data (e.g., vineyard conditions, certification records) to on-chain transactions.
